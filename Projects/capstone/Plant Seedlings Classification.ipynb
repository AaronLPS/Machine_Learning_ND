    "Weed control, which directly affect the efficiency of algoricoutul, has been researched for several decades. Keeping crop free of weeds is critical in good farm management. Farmers should plan their farm activities well so that they do weeding at the right time and in the right way. For this purpose, to differentiate weed from crop seedling is the essential step. Different seedlings have their unique features on their colors, shape, and outlines. Multiple technologies have been adopted including GPS mapping, ground-based vision identification, remote sensors and so on. This project focuses on to identify and classify the seedlings from the image using machine learning based computer vision.  Fortunately  Aarhus University and University of Southern Denmark recently released a dataset containing images of approximately 960 unique plants belonging to 12 species at several growth stages. those labeled data provides the researchers an opportunity to experiment with different image recognition techniques(for instance, K-nearest, SVM, CNN, and other high performance deep learning models). Kaggle also helped to organize an online competition providing a platform to let researchers communicate and cross-compare the solutions.\n",

    "\n",
    "The topic of this project is to use provided dataset training weed recognition algorithms. The most critical part is to select and adjust the architecture of the model togher with its hyper-paramaters to push the limits of the accuracy. To get inspiration from previous research results, transform learning becomes a good start point. The dataset from AU & SDU consists of different seeding images and labeled classification will be used for training and testing separately. The performance will be evaluated on MeanFScore, which at Kaggle is a micro-averaged F1-score."

    "The goal of the project is to train a model/classifier that can recognize the seedlings from the image input. Considering the type of the input as the image, Convolutional Neural Networks was considered as a good option to start given its abilities on visual applications. Different architectures of CNN with transfer learning will be evaluated and tuned for the use case. ImageNet database and its relevant projects provide multiple high potential models worthy to take a test. Data visualiztion method like tensorbord will be used to monitor the performance during the training. The model will be measured using MeanFScore."
